# Kanvas

This repository is a project my team and I worked on for IST 261 between November and December 2021. This is a simulation of Canvas, a student portal application. Our version of it is much simpler than the original application. With Kanvas, students can submit assignments, participate in discussions, and take tests or quizzes. Teachers can also create assignments, discussion forums, tests and quizzes for students. This application was written in Java, uses JUnit for testing, and was created in the IntelliJ IDEA IDE.
